# warriors-battle

The project is incomplete and not at his final stage.

A simple command-line battle with warriors uuuh i'm too lazy to make a proper README for now so have fun reading the code.

# short-explanation

Fight between 2 fighters; gameplay is turn-based, where the warrior chooses his action between attack, defense, parry, where attacking deals damage and uses STAMINA, defending reduces the damage taken and restores some stamina, and last but not least parrying has a chance to stun the enemy; either succeeding and failing the parry gives stamina.

Bruh i'll do a better read me in the future, sorry for the bad english me retarded.
